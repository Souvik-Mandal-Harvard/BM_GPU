# Configuration File
### *config.md*

The configuration file is where you will define the parameters for the models used in this pipeline will be defined. This is also where you will update your camera setup to help inform the rate of different behavioral changes. Hopefully, this document will help you explain some of the parameters in a intuitive manner with possible ethological explanation. 
*Note: It may require you to run multiple iterations of thes pipeline with different parameters to get the most optimal behavioral space*
